## Penetration Testing (OSCP  Guidebook/Cheatsheet Repository)
A guidebook that can be followed from enumeration to post exploitation. The repository is a collection of useful commands and tips that I have learned for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam. This was created during my senior year of university with a passion for information security.
